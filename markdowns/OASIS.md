# Getting Started with OASIS
_Open Algebra Software for Inferring Solutions is a C++ library for embedding computer algebra and symbolic manipulation._

OASIS is a sophisticated mathematical expression library designed to facilitate the symbolic manipulation of expressions within software applications. It provides a comprehensive framework for defining, simplifying, and evaluating expressions across various mathematical domains, such as real numbers, imaginary numbers, variables, and complex mathematical functions like exponents and logarithms. The library is built with extensibility in mind, supporting the implementation of custom expression types and the integration of advanced computational features like differentiation and structural comparison. OASIS employs a robust system of expression trees that allows for efficient expression manipulation and supports asynchronous operations, making it well-suited for complex computational tasks in scientific, engineering, and educational software. Through its well-structured classes and interfaces, OASIS serves as a powerful tool for developers needing to perform precise and versatile mathematical computations.
