### Exponent.hpp
Exponent.hpp and Exponent.cpp files within the Oasis namespace define the Exponent class, a specialized type of binary expression that represents exponentiation operations in a symbolic mathematics framework. 
**Specializations:** A specialized version of the class is provided for when both the base and the power are of type Expression. This general form allows the class to handle various types of expressions dynamically.
**Key Methods:**
- Constructors: Standard and copy constructors to initialize an exponent expression.
- Simplify(): Implements logic to simplify the exponent expression, potentially reducing complex expressions to simpler or more canonical forms based on mathematical rules.
- ToString(): Generates a string representation of the expression in the form of base^power.
- Differentiate(): Provides functionality to differentiate the exponent expression with respect to a given variable, a critical operation for calculus applications.
- Specialize(): Methods to convert a general Expression into a more specific Exponent expression if applicable.

**Expression Traits:**
- Type and Category: Marks the expression with EXPRESSION_TYPE (Exponent)
**Constructor Implementation:** Initializes an exponent expression from two sub-expressions, setting them as the base and power.

**Simplification Logic:**
- Simplifies both the base and power of the expression.
- Handles specific cases like zero or one powers, zero base, and real number calculations using properties of exponents.
- Implements transformations for special cases involving imaginary numbers and logarithmic forms.

**Differentiation Logic:**
- Differentiates the exponent expression based on the power rule and chain rule for derivatives, handling cases specifically when the power is a constant and the base is the variable of differentiation.

**Specialization and Generalization:**
- Provides mechanisms to adapt a general Expression into an Exponent if it fits the structure, enabling dynamic handling of various expression forms within the mathematical framework.

**Error Handling and Special Cases:** 
- Addresses common and edge cases in exponentiation, such as zero exponents, one as a base or exponent, and negative bases with fractional exponents, ensuring robust mathematical computations.
**Symbolic Differentiation:** Incorporates functionality to differentiate exponent expressions, crucial for alculus-related operations and symbolic computation.
### Log.hpp
Log is a template class derived from BinaryExpression. It uses two types via template parameters, BaseT and ArgumentT, both conforming to the IExpression interface. It provides an implementation to handle logarithmic operations.
**Specialized Constructor:** For the general case where both base and argument are of type Expression, providing flexibility to handle various expression forms.
**Key Methods:**
- Simplify(): Implements logic to simplify the logarithmic expression based on mathematical properties of logarithms.
- ToString(): Generates a string representation in the format log(base, argument).
- Specialize(): Methods to convert a general Expression into a more specific Log expression if possible.

**Expression Traits:**
- Type: Defined with EXPRESSION_TYPE(Log).
- Category: It does not belong to any specific category like associative or commutative, as logarithms do not generally conform to these properties.
**Constructor:** Initializes a log expression from a base and an argument, setting up the binary expression framework.

**Simplification Logic:**
- Handles edge cases such as non-positive base or argument and base equal to one.
- For real numbers, computes logarithm using properties such as 
log<sub>b</sub>(a) = log<sub>2</sub>(a) / log<sub>2</sub>(b) for real a and b.
- Can handle expressions like log<sub>b</sub>(a<sup>x</sup>) = x * log<sub>b</sub>(a), leveraging the exponential form to simplify expressions.
- Uses Undefined for cases outside the domain of the logarithm function, such as a negative or zero argument.

**Error Handling:**
- The code robustly handles mathematical errors and domain issues by potentially returning an Undefined object for cases like negative or zero arguments or bases.

**Special Case Handling:**
- Incorporates logic to handle special cases in logarithms, such as converting logarithmic forms involving exponents and handling undefined mathematical operations.
